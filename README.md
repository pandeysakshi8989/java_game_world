Let's dive deep into java GUI concept with games
This repository has two branches
First branch JavaGame has a tictac toe game code in Swing GUI.
Second branch Games has three games that can be played one by one with switch case used in Games.java
These three are console based game unlike Swing GUI.
I have task to make other two games also into swing GUI and give user choice either of three games through GUI form.
I hope you would like the code.
